# Syntax errors
These types of errors are ones that occur when you run your code and then it breaks
Syntax errors are simple to *spot and fix*

Syntax errors occur when we don't follow the rules of the language completely.

EOL = end of line
- when there is a missing closing quotation at the end

type "python 3" to access the syntax spotter
# Semantic errors

semantic errors occur when our code doesn't MEAN what we intend it to MEAN.

These errors, in Mr.Ubial's opinion, are FAR MORE challenging to spot and fix.

'''python
user_response = input("Do you like to eat food?")

if user_response == "yes":
	print("You are a human.")
else:
	print("You must be some sort of robot.")

The problem with the code above is subtle. What I (Mr.Ubial) mean is that EVERY ANSWER OF YES should go into the YES block.
