# Python cannot compute over two digits of math
#       1           +           1 
# operant above  binary operator  operant above

# order of operation
# operators that work on numbers 
print(1+1)
print(1-1)
print(10*10)
print(9/3)

# division operations yield floats 

print(1_909_098)

# underscores are used to make the number more readable

print(1+3/1+5) # output based on 1 +(3/1)+5 
# Python follows BEDMAS

# To raise a number to the power of 
print(2**10)

# floor division: gets rid of the decimal
print(9//2)

# modulo : useful for finding out if numbers are divisible
# Modulo gives you the reminder in a division question
print(9%2)
