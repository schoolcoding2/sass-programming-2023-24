# Output
we can display text and symbols using output

we use the print() function to display output

'''python
print(insert text)
'''

#  Comments 
Comments are pieces of text that are *NOT* interpreted by python
This means that the text is ignored
We use the # symbol to make comments

# [[headers]]


# Input 
we grab information from the user using input()
It will wait for the user to type something in and press Enter/Return

'''python


# Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time our app is running
- idea of persistence
- once our programming is done; it is gone

'''python
favourite_food = input ("What is your favourite food")
'''

^ the variable in this case is "favourite food"

- variable = operator
- compared to math 1+1 =2 
- the operator is (+)

favourite food -> name of the variable

= -> assignment operator 

input... -> value 

# [[strings]]



f = special format string, allows you to answer based on respond 

(f ''.. {fave_food} sounds good.'')


# [[Design]]

# [[lists ]]

# [[modules]]


you only need to import ONCE
you put the import at top right under the header
