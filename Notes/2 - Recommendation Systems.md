# Recommendation systems
Popularity and "Likes"

This type of paradigm is makes a suggestion based on how many people "like" the entity.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram. When you click on the heart button, Instagram records it somewhere along the other data like demographic and psychographic information. With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and services that you like. 

We implemented the Popularity/Likes paradigm with our Favourite Bubble Tea activity. 

## N-Point Rating system

N-point rating systems are used by many services particularly Amazon.

An example of an N-point rating system would be Amazon's product review system using stars.  
	The system is rated using from 1-5 stars, with 5 stars being the highest and 1 star being the lowest. 

This paradigm provides more granular information. Buyers are asked to rate the product uding s 5-point scale.
