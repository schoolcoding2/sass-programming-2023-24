An elegant way to code a complex algorithm, without needing loops

you need:
a function
where the function is defined by the function itself

draw tree takes two input:

1. define the level of the tree
2. define the place to put the function inside the function

	there must be a branch/place to put the function
	have a place to put the function inside the function 

Recursion is an elegant way to repeat a pattern

Fractals are examples of patterns that can be described recursively 

A recursive function must have three parts:

1. A function 
2. somewhere in the body code block, the function should call itself. 
3. A base case. This is where the function STOPS CALLING itself. 

Factorials and Recursion

```
0! = 1
1! = 1

2! = 1 * 2 
2! = 1! * 2

3! = 1 * 2 * 3
3! = 2! * 3
```
